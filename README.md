# Facial Recognition System

*Developer:* Zain Ahmed  
*Overview:*  
This project is a Python-based facial recognition system designed to identify individuals using a trained deep learning model.  
It detects, processes, and matches faces with stored records, demonstrating principles of machine learning and computer vision.

*Features:*  
- Real-time face detection and recognition  
- Face data stored securely in SQL database  
- User interface for registration and recognition  
- Scalable architecture for multi-user environments  

*Tech Stack:*  
- Python (OpenCV, NumPy, face_recognition library)  
- SQL for database management  
- Tkinter for GUI (if applicable)  

*Impact:*  
Deployed as part of an AI/ML internship project at Virtual Technocrat Network.  
Adopted by 23 client companies and contributed to $1,250 in project revenue.

*Learning Outcome:*  
Strengthened understanding of AI model training, data handling, and ethical implications of recognition systems.

*Note:*  
This repository includes core recognition logic and database structure.
